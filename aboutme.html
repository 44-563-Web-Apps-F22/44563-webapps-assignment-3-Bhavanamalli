        <h1>Bhavana Malli</h1>
        <p>I am a congenial person who is intersted in games born and raised in Bapatla,Andhra pradesh.
            Completed my under graduation in 2020.I have an experince of 1.5 years as an Programmer Analyst in
             Cognizant Technological solutions,hyderabad.Currently pursing my Masters in Applied Computer Science 
             At Nortwest Missouri State University.</p>
        <h5>My favourite movie is Shiddat</h5>
        <p>
            The name itself gives the meaning of movie i.e shiddat which is nothing but dedication.
            from this movie we can able to see that how dedicated one is either it may be in love,about the life or 
            anything that you want to do in our life.In this movie we can see that how hardly he will try to reach his love.Here loving is not
             important but the dedicated journey that he had to reach out his girlfriend is all the movie about.So,what i learnt from this movie is that what ever may be the situation you never want to give up  on things until your really done you need to give your best "Never give up".
